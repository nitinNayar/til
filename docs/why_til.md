The reason I created this TIL repo & What's the **main theme/focus** of the TIL series?

There are 4 main reasons and themes I want to cover in this TIL:

* AI Native Solutions Engineering- AI has changed the way we do our work. I want this blog to showcase, how I as a Solutions Engineer use AI on a daily basis to make my life easier and more efficient. In addition, AI is also opening up high value use cases like thinking partner, time management and accountability coach. I want to share my concrete workflows & ideas about how to adapt workflows to make you AI Native. 

* at many startups, devs use tools like Datadog for troubleshooting. While as SE's we don't need to know how to use them, these can be very helpful in mulitple ways: (1) when you open a ticket with ENG, you can pinpoint the exact reason, leading to faster fixes and building cred/trust (2) when you are in the middle of the POV, you can self serve the initial troubleshooting- makes you come out as an expert with your customer

* a third topic I want to focus on is actionable guidance on showcasing how to demonstrate business value in a POV. As an SE, one of our key deliverables is to translate technical features into business value for our customers. I will share some examples of how i did this based on my SE experience.

* fourth topic- how to plan for and execute a successful POV- how many times as an SE, we jump into a POV and later realise, we don't have the right folks involved? 

* fifth topic- AI native personal planner / to-do list manager- more details in @work_in_progress/ai_native_personal_planner/README.md
