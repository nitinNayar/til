# TIL

> Today I Learned

We constantly learn new things. This is a repo to share those learnings. A collection of concise write-ups on small things I learn day to day across a variety of languages and technologies. TILs are short Markdown documents (a few sentences + example code) explaining concepts, bits of syntax, commands, or tips we've recently learned. These are things that don't really warrant a full blog post. 


> **My Philosophy:** If I have to Google it twice, I document it here.

## 🎯 About This Repository

This TIL collection is built from a **Solutions Engineer's perspective**, focusing on practical workflows and tools that solve real customer scenarios.

### The Three Pillars

**1. 🤖 AI-Native Solutions Engineering**
AI has fundamentally changed how we work. This TIL showcases concrete workflows for using AI as a thinking partner, accountability coach, and efficiency multiplier in day-to-day SE work. Beyond just making tasks faster, AI is opening up high-value use cases like strategic thinking partnerships, time management, and goal accountability.

**2. 🔍 Self-Service Troubleshooting**
At many startups, devs use tools like DataDog for troubleshooting. While SEs don't need deep expertise, knowing the basics delivers concrete value:
- **Build credibility with Engineering:** When you open a ticket, you can pinpoint the exact issue (service, query, timeout) leading to faster fixes and stronger cross-team trust
- **Shine during POVs:** Self-serve initial troubleshooting instead of escalating immediately. This positions you as an expert partner with your customer, not just a product demo-er

**3. 💼 Translating Technical Features to Business Value**
One of an SE's core deliverables is demonstrating ROI during POVs. This TIL shares actionable examples of how to connect technical capabilities to measurable business outcomes—moving beyond "here's a cool feature" to "here's how this saves you $X or prevents Y risk."
