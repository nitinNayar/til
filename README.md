# TIL

> Today I Learned

We constantly learn new things. This is a repo to share those learnings. A collection of concise write-ups on small things I learn day to day across a variety of languages and technologies. TILs are short Markdown documents (a few sentences + example code) explaining concepts, bits of syntax, commands, or tips we've recently learned. These are things that don't really warrant a full blog post. 


> **My Philosophy:** If I have to Google it twice, I document it here.
